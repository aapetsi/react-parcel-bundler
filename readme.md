# Starting the development server

* Run *npm start* to get started.

* Run *npm build* to make a production build.

* Run *npm test* to run test files.
  Add *-- --watchAll* flag to run tests in watch mode.
  For some strange reason on Linux - Ubuntu you need to run the test with sudo

* Happy hacking :)
